htmlSanitize()

Description
    array htmlSanitize(array $var [, $quotes = ENT_QUOTES [, string $charset = "UTF-8" [, bool $doubleEncode = TRUE]]])
    This function extends PHP's htmlentities() by accepting an array of string values rather than a single string value.
	
Parameters
	var
		An array containing applicable string elements to convert to HTML entities.
		
	quotes
		Defines what will be done with 'single' and "double" quotes. It takes on one of three constants with the default being ENT_QUOTES.
		ENT_COMPAT  	Will convert double-quotes and leave single-quotes alone.
		ENT_QUOTES 		Will convert both double and single quotes.
		ENT_NOQUOTES 	Will leave both double and single quotes unconverted.
		
	charset
		Defines character set used in conversion. Presently, EngineCMS uses the UTF-8 character set as the default.  See Notes for link to other character sets.
		
	doubleEncode
		If doubleEncode is set to FALSE PHP will not encode existing HTML entities.  The default is to convert everything.
Return Values
    Returns the original array, $var, with the applicable characters converted to HTML entities in each of the array's elements.
	
Examples

		}
		
		if (isset($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'])) {
			$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] = htmlSanitize($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']);
		}
		...
