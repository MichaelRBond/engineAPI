obsafe_print_r()

Description
    void obsafe_print_r(mixed $var [, bool $return = TRUE [, unsigned int $level = 0]])
	An alternative to print_r that unlike the original does not use output buffering with the return parameter set to true. Thus, Fatal errors that 
	would be the result of print_r in return-mode within ob handlers can be avoided.  Comes with an extra parameter to be able to generate html code. 

Parameters
	var
		The expression to be printed.
		
	return
		Whether to return the string value, $output, to the calling statement or to echo $ouput.
		
	level
		The number of levels to be printed.
    
Return Values
    Returns the string value, $output, if $return is set to TRUE.  The value is TRUE by default.

   Support for printing of objects as well as the $return parameter functionality added by Fredrik Wollsén (fredrik dot motin at gmail), to make it 
   work as a drop-in replacement for print_r (Except for that this function does not output paranthesises around element groups...).  Based on
