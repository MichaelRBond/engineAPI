    Constructor for the dlxs class.
    
Parameters
    url
    	String value describing the base url for the dlxs collection links.
    class
    	String value describing which class to use. Currently, only "image" and "findingaid" classes are described.
    collection
    	String value describing the collection identifier.
    engine
    	The engine object.

Return Values
	Dlxs class.

Examples
	<?
	...
	$dlxs = &$GLOBALS['dlxsObject'];
	$dlxs = new dlxs("http://findingaids.lib.wvu.edu","findingaid","wvcguide",$engine);
	...
	?>

Notes
	As seen in the example section, the variable that is being used must be set to &$GLOBALS['dlxsObject'] before the class is constructed. This is needed to be able to use {dlxs ... } tags.
